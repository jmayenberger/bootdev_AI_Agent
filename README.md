# AI Coding Agent Showcase

This project showcases an AI coding agent that can interact with a file system, read and write files, and execute Python code. It uses the Gemini API to generate responses and function calls.

**Important Note:** This project is a demonstration and is **not robust enough for public use**. It lacks proper security measures and input validation, which could make it vulnerable to malicious attacks. Therefore, it should only be used for demonstration purposes and not deployed in any production environment.

## Features

*   Lists files and directories.
*   Reads file contents.
*   Executes Python files.
*   Writes and overwrites files.
*   Uses the Gemini API for natural language interaction and function calling.
